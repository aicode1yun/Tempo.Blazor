# Changelog

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-04

- Added the UI role vocabulary model for wireframe authoring, including built-in role synonyms and app-scoped role resolution.
- Added role-aware wireframe authoring through MCP operations and `wireframe_author_document`, with advisory warnings for role gaps, ambiguous matches, enum normalization, off-canvas placement, text overflow, required content, and layout issues.
- Added compact/filterable `wireframe_get_authoring_guide` output with category, type, role, target pack, app scope, skip, and take filters.
- Added container-aware wireframe linting through `isContainer`, so expected containment does not appear as sibling overlap.
- Added `WireframeThumbnailRenderer` in `Tempo.Blazor.Wireframe` and moved the Demo API document-library preview generation onto the package renderer.
- Updated the wireframe document schema and JSON documentation for document version 2.1, element roles, component roles, container metadata, MCP authoring, and thumbnails.
- Bumped published package metadata to `2.1.0` and aligned release workflows to derive manual/CI versions from the core package version.

Release follow-up after review: commit the prepared changes, merge to main, tag `v2.1.0`, push, then verify NuGet.org publication with a clean-project package-install smoke.
